This repository documents the data and scripts for the paper "Horizontal and vertical penetration: Unveiling the reshaped locations of consumption spaces in the digital era in China". 

## Abstract
As consumption plays an increasingly important role in cities, reshaped consumption spaces in the digital era have become more critical in influencing urban spatial structures. This study uses shop data from the online-to-offline platform, Dazhong Dianping, to measure micro-scale location changes of consumption spaces from 2015 to 2019 in prefecture-level cities in China. The results reveal a trend of consumption spaces increasingly penetrating inner areas of street blocks (horizontally) and buildings (vertically). Experiential consumption spaces, such as escape rooms, eyelash salons, makeup studios, and board game caf√©s, show a greater tendency to be located in non-storefront and non-ground floor areas. Furthermore, cities with higher tiers, larger populations, higher economic statuses, increased internet penetration rates, and more developed tertiary industries exhibit higher degrees and growth in the penetration of consumption spaces. This research prompts rethinking traditional location theory and adapting to evolving urban functions and land use in the digital era.
